# Randomized and Big Data Algorithms Final Project

### Alexander Glavin and Conner Delahanty

> This repository has code and artifacts for our Randomized and Big Data Algorithms (601.434/634) 
> final project. In this, we implimented the Mean Coreset Algorithm proposed by Nasser et al. in 
> [Coresets for Kinematic Data: From Theories to Real-Time Systems] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09120.pdf), 
> to optimize and perform and big-data linear regression. 

> Sample code, graphics, and more can be found on this page.
